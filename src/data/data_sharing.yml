    The development time for a Data Collector depends on the complexity of the shared data. Typically, the development time is around 2 months, which we usually break down into 4 sprints:
    - **Sprint 1** (weeks 1-2): basic configuration of the Data Collector
    - **Sprint 2** (weeks 3-4): development of the adapter part with respect to the customer’s API
    - **Sprint 3** (weeks 5-6): development of the adapter part of the Open Data Hub API
    - **Sprint 4** (weeks 7-8): testing and production start of the application
